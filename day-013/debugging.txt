# Debugging

## 1. Describe the Problem
- What is the for-loop doing?
- When is the function meant to print "You got it?"
- What are your assumptions about it?

```python
# Describe Problem
def my_function():
  for i in range(1, 20): # ➡️ range(1, 21)
    if i == 20:
      print("You got it")
my_function()
```

## 2. Reproduce the Bug
- If you encounter it once, but you don't encounter it the next time that becomes a really difficult bug to fix;

```python
# Reproduce the Bug
from random import randint
dice_imgs = ["❶", "❷", "❸", "❹", "❺", "❻"]
dice_num = randint(1, 6) # ➡️ randint(0, 5)
print(dice_imgs[dice_num])
```

- Occasionally you'll get an ==error==:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 14, in <module>
    print(dice_imgs[dice_num])
IndexError: list index out of range
```

## 3. Play Computer
- The skill of pretending to be a computer reading through your code and imagining what you going to do each time is really useful, especially when you're debugging;

```python
# Play Computer
year = int(input("What's your year of birth?"))
if year > 1980 and year < 1994:
  print("You are a millenial.")
elif year > 1994: # ➡️ year >= 1994
  print("You are a Gen Z.")
```

## 4. Fix the errors
- When the editor's giving you an error or when the console's giving you an error, fix the errors before you continue;

```python
# Fix the Errors
age = input("How old are you? ")
if age > 18:
    print("You can drive at age {age}.") # ➡️ indented
```

- That will give us:

```python
How old are you? 20
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 27, in <module>
    if age > 18:
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
```

- Then:

```python
# Fix the Errors
age = input("How old are you? ")
if age > 18:
    print("You can drive at age {age}.") # ➡️ f-string
```

## 5. Print is Your Friend
- Use it as tool to solve your questions about your code;

```python
#Print is Your Friend
pages = 0
word_per_page = 0
pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
# word_per_page == int(input("Number of words per page: "))
word_per_page = int(input("Number of words per page: ")) # ➡️ =
total_words = pages * word_per_page
print(f"pages: {pages}") # ➡️ print your variables
print(f"words per page: {word_per_page}") # ➡️ print your variables
print(total_words)
```

## 6. Use a Debugger
- We've already used www.pythontutor.com and also Thonny editor;

```python
#Use a Debugger
def mutate(a_list):
  b_list = []
  for item in a_list:
    new_item = item * 2
#b_list.append(new_item)
    b_list.append(new_item) # ➡️ include it in the for loop
  print(b_list)

mutate([1,2,3,5,8,13])
```

- With this debugger, we've managed to see line by line what the computer is doing and solve the problem;
- We can actually make this processe even simpler by using a ==breakpoint==;

## Final Tips for Debugging

### 7. Take a Break
### 8. Ask a Friend
### 9. Run Often
### 10. Ask StackOverflow

# Exercises

## Debug Odd or Even Exercise

-   Read this the code in main.py
-   Spot the problems 🐞.
-   Modify the code to fix the program.

Fix the code so that it works and passes the tests when you submit

```python
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))

#if number % 2 = 0:
if number % 2 == 0: # ➡️ ==
  print("This is an even number.")
else:
  print("This is an odd number.")
```

## Debug Leap Year Exercise

-   Read this the code in main.py
-   Spot the problems 🐞.
-   Modify the code to fix the program.
-   No shortcuts - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a working solution.

Fix the code so that it works and when you hit submit it should pass all the tests.

```python
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? ")) # ➡️ int()

if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year.")
    else:
      print("Not leap year.")
  else:
    print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
```

## Debug Fizz Buzz Exercise

-   Read this the code in main.py
-   Spot the problems 🐞.
-   Modify the code to fix the program.
-   No shortcuts - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a working solution.

The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

> Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
>
> When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
>
> When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
>
>   And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

```python
for number in range(1, 101):
  # if number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0: # ➡️ and
  if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0: # ➡️ and
    print("FizzBuzz")
  # if number % 3 == 0:
  elif number % 3 == 0: # ➡️ elif
    print("Fizz")
  # if number % 5 == 0:
  elif number % 5 == 0: # ➡️ elif
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    print(number)
```
